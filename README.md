## About
`Nec Claustra: No Barriers in latin.
 Multilingual Chat Web App`

Nec-Claustra, is a React and Rails web app that was designed and engineered to unlocking language barriers via instant messaging to bring people together..utilizing Google Translate Api.

I initially created this app, implementing IBM Watson's translate API and then later decided to do it again utilizing Google Clouds Translate api for optimization purposes & to be able to detect user languages.

Set up a rails RESTful API with PostgreSQL to store data. JWT tokens, Bcrypt for Login/ReAuth.
